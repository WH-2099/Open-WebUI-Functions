  Retries failed requests and logs errors for transparency.

- **Secure API Key Storage**  
  API keys are encrypted and never exposed in plaintext.

- **Safety Configuration**  
  Control safety behavior using a permissive or strict mode.

- **Customizable Generation Settings**  
  Use environment variables to configure token limits, temperature, etc.

## Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables to configure the Google Gemini integration:

```bash
# API key for authenticating with Google Generative AI
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key"

# Use permissive safety settings for content generation (true/false)
USE_PERMISSIVE_SAFETY=false

# Model list cache duration (in seconds)
GOOGLE_MODEL_CACHE_TTL=600

# Number of retry attempts for failed API calls
GOOGLE_RETRY_COUNT=2
```
